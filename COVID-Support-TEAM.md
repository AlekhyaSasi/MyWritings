## Remember
1. While on call, consider taking 5-10 seconds to appreciate any health care worker (hospital staff, medical staff, volunteers, food suppliers) or anyone who is actively working. 
2. Some patients or attendants might be emotional and start expressing themselves. Consider spending time listening to them. It brings emotional relief to them. (Of course, not anything more than a min).
3. If you find out that a requirement is closed, try to find out the resource they used for future references.
