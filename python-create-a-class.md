  Python code is mostyl implemented through Classes. 
  
  Python programming helps you to reuse code, making it easy to maintain and scale. 
  
  Use this guide to know how to create Python classes and how to store values in it dynamacially and staticly.
  
  ## What is a Class? 
  
  A class is a template to objects. Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into an entity, that is an instance of a class. i.e A class contains related block
  of code and object's functions act on variables stored within the object. Unlike a function, a Class also contains variables (properties) and functions (methods). 
  
  ### Example:
  
  Consider a class `person_details` which stores person's information. In that case, a single person such as `Alekhya` is thhe instance of the class. `person_details` class contains
  details about the person such as first name, last name, age
