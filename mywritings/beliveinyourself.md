**Believe in yourself **

"You can’t do it. You’ll never be good enough. You’re going to fail."

This voice taunts you whenever you set a goal. It criticizes you when life gets difficult. It beats you down when you struggle to stand up against its running commentary. Self-doubt is greedy. When it’s loose, it devours your confidence, strips logic and reason from your mind, and steals happiness from your heart. In return, it leaves you with only fear and insecurity.

You try to remove self-doubt by forcing yourself to *think positive*, which usually doesn’t work as well as you think it should. The more you fight your self-doubt, the more it fights back. Sometimes all you need to believe in yourself is **courage** *(when you don’t have any assurances of the outcome but take action anyway)*. Often you need perseverance (not being discouraged by failure into quitting) to keep going even when you fail. But perseverance doesn’t necessarily require you to 'believe in yourself.' You just need to understand and <span class="special">acknowledge</span> that everyone needs to practice and have more experience before they master anything. Once you master something, you will have `self-confidence` and belief in yourself.

```Right now is the right moment! ```

##### *"Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has many--not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some." --Charles Dickens*

>Why are you searching for reasons to fail ? 
>Instead figure out a way to make something good happen.
>>The biggest difference between successful people and unsuccessful ones is that, successful people are determined to make the situation work for them rather than playing the role of the victim and searching for reasons why a situation won’t work.

###**Trust and Love Yourself **

You probably spend more time being your own worst enemy instead of being your own best friend. But you deserve to treat yourself better. After all, you have the rest of your life to spend with yourself.

Think of it this way: Would you mentally abuse or condemn your loved ones? Would you let them suffer in their time of need? If not, then why would you do it to yourself?

So, be kind to yourself. You are more capable and worthy than you give yourself credit for.

####**Ways to believe in yourself**

 - Be positive 
	 - For example, if you catch yourself having a negative thought like, “I am terrible at math,” re-frame the thought in a more productive way by saying something like, "I find math challenging, but I am working hard and improving."
 - Make a list of your past accomplishments.  Identify what you have done well over and over again to understand your skills.
 -  Talk to people who love you
	 - Sometimes we have difficulty seeing the best things about ourselves, but the people who love us will never struggle to see those things.   
 - Find a cause that you believe in
	 - The passion that you feel for these causes and projects will help you to work harder and see how much you can achieve.
 - Set realistic goals
	 - Be prepared to go outside of your comfort zone now and then. Work hard until you achieve it. 
 - Reflect at the end of each day
 - Be persistent 
	 - It’s perfectly natural to struggle with something the first time you do it. Instead of blaming yourself for doing something wrong, give yourself permission to experiment without worrying about the consequences.
 - Connect with people
 - Find ways to keep moving forward
	 -  Sometimes all that’s required is a change of scenery, or perhaps a disruption in your everyday routine.
 - Be proactive
	 - Instead of letting everyday life demands pile on top of each other, tackle them as soon as you think about it. 
 - Take on challenges
	 - Do things that will be rewarding, even though they'll be hard work. 
 - Practice speaking up for yourself
	 - When things are happening around you, and you have an opinion or know a better way to do something, speak up! Don't just accept things the way they are. 
 - Help others
	 - By helping others, you will find yourself feeling more confident than ever.
 - Pay attention to your appearance and hygiene
	 - You can make sure that you are looking and feeling your best by keeping a good daily hygiene and grooming routine.
 - Nourish your body with healthy food
	 - Make sure that you contribute to your overall well-being by only putting healthy food into your body.
 - Exercise every day
	 - Make sure to include at least 30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine to reap the physical and mental health benefits of exercise.
 - Get plenty of sleep
	 - Try to get about 8 hours of sleep per night to avoid these adverse effects.
 - Relax every day
	 - Find something that works for you and add it into your daily routine.
 - Maintain a pleasant environment
	 -  Maintain a clean and pleasant home for yourself.
